# ML-MCDM Project Objectives

## Dataset
Panel data of 20 component scores for the sustainable development index of 64 provinces in Vietnam from 2020-2024.

## Project Objectives

### Objective 1: Current Year Index Calculation (2024)
Calculate composite sustainability index scores and rankings for 64 provinces using 20 component scores (2024) with **10 MCDM methods** (TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, COPRAS, EDAS + Fuzzy variants) combined through ensemble aggregation.

### Objective 2: Future Year Forecasting (2025)
Forecast sustainability index scores for 64 provinces using historical data (2020-2024) with advanced ML ensemble (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Bayesian) and apply multiple MCDM methods to predicted values.
