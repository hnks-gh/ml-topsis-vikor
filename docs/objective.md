# ML-MCDM Project Objectives

## Dataset
Panel data of 29 component scores for the sustainable development index of 64 provinces in Vietnam from 2011-2024 (14 years).

## Project Objectives

### Objective 1: Current Year Index Calculation (2024)
Calculate composite sustainability index scores and rankings for 64 provinces using 29 component scores (2024) with MCDM methods (TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, COPRAS, EDAS + Fuzzy variants) combined through ensemble aggregation.

### Objective 2: Future Year Forecasting (2025)
Forecast sustainability index scores for 64 provinces using historical data (2011-2024, 14 years) with UnifiedForecaster ensemble (7 models: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Bayesian Ridge, Huber, MLP, Attention) and apply multiple MCDM methods to predicted values.
